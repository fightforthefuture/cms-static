<h3>FCC ‘Net Neutrality’ Plan Calls for More Power Over Broadband 
Chairman Tom Wheeler Considers Hybrid Approach to Internet Access</h3>
<p>
WASHINGTON—The head of the Federal Communications Commission is laying the groundwork for expanding the agency’s authority over broadband service, people familiar with his thinking say, a move long sought by advocates of 
stricter regulation of Internet-service providers. But the plan by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler isn’t expected to satisfy all proponents of “net neutrality”—the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally—because it would still allow broadband providers to cut deals with content companies for special access to customers. 
<p>
The people familiar with the plan emphasized that nothing is final, noting that any proposal would require a vote of the full five-member commission, which is made up of three Democrats and two Republicans. And whatever approach the FCC tries almost certainly will be met with a legal challenge from broadband providers, who would resist giving the agency a heavier hand. Mr. Wheeler has said an open Internet is a goal in developing the rules, along with barring providers from slowing down or blocking content to consumers. Reclassifying broadband to expand the FCC’s authority without explicitly banning broadband providers’ deals would allow the agency to keep such authority in its back pocket to block any arrangements that it views as anticompetitive. He also wants to ensure that the FCC’s final rules, which are expected by year-end, can hold up in court. Advocates of net neutrality say that the only way to achieve it is to classify 
the Internet as common carrier, or a public utility. The
 broadband providers would like the FCC to keep them classified as 
information services, which makes the industry subject to far less 
regulation.
<p>
Caught in the middle, Mr. Wheeler is close to settling on a hybrid approach, people close to the chairman say. The emerging proposal is a departure from an FCC plan put forth last spring, which kept broadband classified as an information service, though Mr. Wheeler at the time made clear that he welcomed input on whether to go the common-carrier route.The
 plan now under consideration would separate broadband into two distinct
 services: a retail one, in which consumers would pay broadband 
providers for Internet access; and a back-end one, in which broadband 
providers serve as the conduit for websites to distribute content. The 
FCC would then classify the back-end service as a common carrier, giving
 the agency the ability to police any deals between content companies 
and broadband providers.
<p>
The emerging plan reflects proposals submitted by the Mozilla Foundation 
and the Center for Democracy and Technology, though it departs from both
 in parts. The main advantage of the hybrid proposal, as opposed to full
 reclassification, is that it wouldn’t require the FCC to reverse 
earlier decisions to deregulate broadband providers, which were made in 
the hopes of encouraging the adoption and deployment of high-speed 
broadband. The authors of the new proposal believe that not having to 
justify reversing itself would put the FCC on firmer legal ground.A
 spokesman for the FCC said that all reclassification options are under 
consideration, including proposals by Mozilla, the CDT and others.Previous
 FCC rules have been overturned by federal courts. 
<p>
In January, an appeals court said the commission was trying to regulate the broadband providers as common carriers but hadn’t designated them as such. Mr. Wheeler’s original plan would have relied on the FCC’s existing 
authority over broadband, while policing content deals on a case-by-case
 basis, depending on whether they are “commercially reasonable.”Net-neutrality proponents reacted to the May proposal by flooding the agency with  millions of tcomments, many of which called for reclassification and a flat ban on deals for special access to consumers. President Obama 
recently called for the FCC to bar the practice, which is known as paid 
prioritization.
<p>
People familiar with the FCC’s thinking say the agency remains skeptical of a flat ban on paid prioritization, noting that even common carriers are 
allowed to charge for certain specialized services. Mr. Wheeler 
suggested in December that he would be open to some such arrangement. He
 has been careful since then to emphasize that the FCC won’t tolerate 
harmful discrimination, though hasn’t called for a flat ban.FCC officials believe that maintaining lower-cost broadband offerings could help close the income gap in broadband adoption.
<p>
The proposal would leave the door open for broadband providers to offer 
specialized services for, say, videogamers or online video providers, 
which require a particularly large amount of bandwidth. The proposal 
would also allow the commission to explore usage-based pricing at some 
point, in which consumers are charged based on how much data they use 
and companies are able to subsidize traffic to their websites or 
applications.
<p>
While the FCC still believes there should be room for such deals, its latest plan would shift the burden to the broadband providers to prove that the arrangements would be beneficial to consumers and equally available to any company that would like to participate. FCC officials believe reclassification would put them on much stronger legal footing to block such deals when they are anticompetitive.
<p>
After Mr. Wheeler last spring broached reclassification, the response was 
overwhelming, with advocates of net neutrality calling for the FCC to 
reclassify broadband. One industry official admitted the hybrid plans could be more tolerable “at the margins,” but predicted they would prompt the same legal challenge from the broadband providers as full reclassification. Reclassification “could not withstand judicial review,” Verizon Communications Inc. Deputy General Counsel Michael Glover wrote in a white paper submitted to the FCC on Wednesday.
<p>
Broadband providers say reclassification would give the FCC wide-ranging 
authority over everything from content to pricing and that it would 
curtail investment in upgrading and expanding broadband networks</p>
