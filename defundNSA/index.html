      support the Fourth Amendment and support Representative Amash's
      amendment to HR-2397 when it comes up for a vote this week. The
      amendment would place some important limitations on domestic
      surveillance by the NSA. And please note that the Nugent amendment is
      not enough, because it does not stop the NSA's current surveillance
      activities.

      Once again, I'm asking for Representative _______ to support
      Representative Amash's amendment to HR-2397.

            <p>By now you know that the NSA has been indiscriminately collecting information on innocent people all over the world.</p>
<p>We are working on many fronts to undermine their ability to spy, and right now we have a chance to deal a major blow to the agency that has so profoundly violated our privacy.</p>
<p>Rep. Justin Amash and several other Congress members have introduced <a href="http://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/AMASH_018_xml2718131717181718.pdf"> an amendment </a> to the Defense Appropriations bill that would significantly limit the NSA's ability to constantly monitor and track people.</p>
<p><b>Here's the key text:</b></p>
<p><i>None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to execute a
 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order pursuant to section 501 
of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861) 
that does not include the following sentence: ‘‘This Order limits the 
collection of any tangible things (including telephone numbers dialed, 
telephone numbers of incoming calls, and the duration of calls) that may
 be authorized  to be collected pursuant to this Order to those tangible
 things that pertain to a person who is the subject of an investigation 
described in section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of
 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861).’</i></p>
