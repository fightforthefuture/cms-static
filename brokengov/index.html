<h4>Denial, Disorder, Failure</h4>
<p>Checks and balances are necessary to a working democracy. Instead, President Obama is stonewalling, Congress has no oversight, and only secret courts that don't need to disclose have a say. Sound like 1984?</p>
</div>

<div class="thumbi">
<h4>Power to fire anyone</h4>
<p>Ever sign a petition? Believe we should have the right to? Now, with PRISM, the gov't knows if you're even slightly political -- simply being tracked chills free speech, silences disagreement; 800,000 people can access PRISM, go rogue, take revenge, target our personal lives.</p>
</div>

<div class="thumbi">
<h4>Everything you do</h4>
<p>Ever buy a one-way ticket? Gchat with relatives abroad? In their world, this puts you on a list. Every place you go, every thing you buy. That many records on our lives is power. They're making you question everything you do.</p>

<h2>Our Values</h2>
<h3>The 4th Amendment</h3>
<p>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."</p>
</div>

<div class="columnb">
<h2>Now Broken</h2>
<h3>PRISM: Total Information Awareness</h3>
<p>Under a secret interpretation of FISA and their seret court, the NSA has created the largest intelligence gathering program in history. Once called Total Information Awareness, this program collects and reads vast amounts of information on Americans and foreigners without warrants. The contract we have as citizens with this government is the Constitution, and they have broken it.</p>
</div>

<div class="columna">
<h2>It's already bad</h2>
<h3>The age of Obama</h3>
<p>When Obama ran for president, he campaigned for civil liberties and against massive surveillance. He ended up being a deciding vote on the Patriot Act.</p>
</div>

<div class="columnb">
<h2>This just makes it worse</h2>
<h3>It's "the era of Bush-Obama</h3>
<p>Bush started the Patriot Act's secret courts and unlimited powers. Obama has overzealously used the Espionage Act to increase those powers -- he's used it 6 out of 9 times its ever been used. </p>
</div>

<div class="columna">
<h3>There's no such thing as privacy anymore</h3>
<p>We've gotten used to signing up for sites that tells us our data is gonna be shared with advertisers. Still, tracking and denying you services is another thing. No one thinks it is fair when you can't buy a house based on your facebook profile.</p>
</div>

<div class="columnb">
<h3>But, it's the government that can brutally imprison.</h3>
<p>Advertisers are one thing, the government is another. The government can brutally imprison anyone. Gving them all of our information, letting them track and monitor us in secret is inviting them to abuse the information they have.</div>

<div class="columna">
<h3>Nothing to Hide</h3>
<p>There are so many federal crimes, the Congressional Research Service can't even count them. Innocent people get incarcerated for vaguely defined laws. </p>
</div>

<div class="columnb">
<h3>It's not just terrorism, it's also same-sex marriage.</h3>
<p>It may not seem wrong, but there's plenty of obscure laws you break every day.. Now, when the cops know everything you're doing illegally, enforcements is just about selection. </p>
</div>

<div class="columna">
<h3>Being tracked can lead to suicide</h3>
<p>The reality of being spied on by the feds is real stress, anxiety, and isolation. We know too many innocent people who have killed themselves under this reality.</p>
</div>

<div class="columnb">
<h3>This is just the tip of the iceberg.</h3>
<p>There's been a whole litany of people being spied on unfairly. If we are seeing this now, what lies behind is deeper disorder, weakness, mismanagement -- the underlying structure is broken and dangerous and fragile. It comes from a political system that is so corrupt, so broken that it can't even see or admit to the problem. </p>
</div>

<div class="columna">
<h3>This country is founded on whistleblowers</h3>
<p>Like our first, Benjamin Franklin. Whistleblowers keep our very large institutions more accountable to the public interest. No one should blindly trust such large institutions that has no checks and balances.</p>
</div>

<div class="columnb">
<h3>What powerful, scared men do</h3>
<p>Obama is going after Edward Snowden and charging him with being a spy. Is this what powerful men do who don't want their secrets exposed?</p>
</div>

<div class="columna">
<h3>If you're a journalist, an activist</h3>
<p>Journalists and activists do the work many of us do not. </p>
</div>
