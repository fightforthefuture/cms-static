                <h1>Dear Google employees,</h1>
            

            

            

            <p>This is no time for half-measures.</p>
<p>The NSA is using secret law to compel you to hand over customer data in ways you should never be required to. They're attacking your private internal cloud, and intercepting your customers emails as they travel to other servers. The NSA and GCHQ are even placing spies at major telecommunications services to subvert the security and privacy of those services.</p>
<p>You are a global company, but America's constitution provides zero privacy protections for users outside the US. And you're dealing with a surveillance apparatus that pushes the limits of the law as far as it can. How can you expect to guarantee <em>any</em> meaningful privacy for non-Americans without a legal or technical sea-change?</p>
<p>There could literally be spies from NSA or GCHQ (a foreign intelligence agency!) working among you, or approaching your HR department right now about jobs on the security team. If there aren't yet, there will be. It's part of the NSA's playbook, and the more you succeed at securing data over the wire, the more the NSA will resort to insider attacks.
Up until now, Google, you've been defensive. Even our personal friends at Google, when asked, hide behind justifications. "It's not our fault.” “We have to do it under US law.” “The telcos are worse." That’s a very natural reaction, but it’s not good enough.</p>
<p>In official public statements it's the same refrain, "We are only complying with the law! Let us report how few data requests we receive. We're innocent but we can't disclose the evidence that would prove it!"
As demands go, that is the weakest demand that Google could make of the government. Say the government grants you transparency. What then? You'll have better talking points to claim innocence, but what changes for your users? The NSA is still reading their searches, gmails, gchats, and gdocs, watching their hangouts, remotely activating the cameras on their glasses, and who knows what else.</p>
<p>What should you ask for? It's simple: the US and UK governments are attacking your users. You need to make them stop.</p>
<p>Google represents the future of the American and global economies. Your lobbying team has grown immensely in the past 3 years. For better or worse, you have the power to change the law, and you know it. For your users, for your conscience, for your future, you need to do something serious.</p>
<p>Right now there's a bill in the US Congress, the USA Freedom Act, that is an excellent start to shutting down the NSA's bulk surveillance operation. We saw how strongly you lobbied against SOPA, a law that endangered the future of the Internet but also threatened your bottom line. You hounded the bill at every turn, organizing friendly members of Congress, testifying in hearings, convening coalitions, talking to countless journalists and Congressional staffers. We'll know that you take your users' privacy seriously when you put just as much lobbying power behind the USA Freedom Act and other deeper reforms.</p>
<p>Right now it's common knowledge among lobbyists and staffers in DC and in the Internet privacy community that changing US surveillance law is not a priority for Google. Google employees aren't on the surveillance response mailing lists, they're not at the meetings, and they're not walking the halls of Congress. That needs to change, now.</p>
<p>To be specific, there needs to be a team of Google employees who understand that their top priority for 2013 is eviscerating the US Government's legal power to violate your users' privacy. The members of Congress they're talking to need to understand that this is a top priority for your company. Anything less, and the world will know you don't really care.</p>
<p>Finally, there are technical measures. In this area, Google deserves a huge amount of credit. You've been years ahead of almost every major tech company in using encryption to secure user data, whether SSL and PFS for websites, START-TLS for email privacy, or whole-phone encryption on Android. You started working on encrypting traffic between data centers before the information that NSA was attacking this connections was even public. All of this is awesome.</p>
<p>But there's a big missing piece. Until now, Google has not given users any way to protect their data from Google. Granted, a lot of this is due to the fact that providing user controlled encryption on the web has been a poorly understood technical problem, and end-to-end encryption breaks some popular features like server-side search. But the tradeoffs are changing. Chat and SMS are more ephemeral than email, and users don’t have the same expectations of search. OTR and TextSecure already offer end-to-end encryption on over Hangouts and the Android SMS framework. Open standards for videoconferencing make end-to-end encryption and key verification easy (See: WebRTC &amp; ZRTP). Encrypted email is a tougher nut to crack, but adding GPG encryption to Gmail is completely within reach of a small group of engineers.</p>
<p>And the best part? US law (for the time being, anyway) actually respects your right to offer end-to-end encryption where users control the keys.
When US law offers no strong privacy protection for non-Americans, and the NSA is actively pursuing insider attacks against tech companies, the only way you can reliably protect users communications from the US government is by protecting that data from Google itself.
So, to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speak out forcefully against surveillance.<em> Lobby hard against surveillance.</em> Use technical measures to make surveillance impossible, including end-to-end encryption that hides data from Google itself.
Right now, Google has a gaping hole, bleeding massive amounts of user data out to the US government. Until that's fixed, every ounce of work you put into building better products and services only lures users into the American surveillance state.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you refuse to choose sides and take these steps in light of recent NSA revelations, you're complicit in the US government's spying on the world. So, Google. Are you with us, or against us? It's that simple.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
