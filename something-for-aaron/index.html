            <p>Dear Internet,</p>
<p>As people who work as activists and in the tech world, and remembering 
that we just lost of one of our major advocates, Aaron Swartz, because 
he was forced to suffer under the unjustness of our judicial and 
political systems, we want to take some time today to address a big 
elephant in the room -- each of us have or know someone who has had 
questions on how to deal with their mental health, but more often than 
not they felt isolated or ashamed to get answers. </p>
<p>We
 thought we should try to do a public service for everyone, and in 
particular, those in our community, and help people find practical 
answers to very common, practical questions around mental health. There 
are answers and basic, scientifically verified research on what helps 
our minds and bodies just to get to a baseline healthy, normal level. We
 hope to open up conversations about problems and solutions to these 
issues. </p>
<p>This
 is an unusual project for us, but something that we think is 
particularly important, and we need your expertise and ideas to get it 
going.  </p>
<p>Together
 with the folks at StackExchange, we’re working to build a new Q&amp;A 
site called ‘Mind’.  We think it will be a fascinating and engaging 
place to explore mental health, mental fitness, memory enhancement, 
stress, sleep, nootropics, depression, flow state, and more.  </p>
<p>Here’s
 what we need right now: visit the staging area that we just setup for 
this new site.  Join it.  Vote up questions you like, submit example 
questions, and help us build towards a launch:
http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/51461/mind</p>
<p>We’ve
 been thinking a lot about how the tech community talks about and 
handles stress, mental health, depression, and related issues.  And we 
hope that this project can help us all take a step towards 
de-stigmatizing conversations around how we feel and how we work with 
mental challenges.  We want to turn that investigative problem solving 
spirit that the tech community embodies towards these issues.</p>
<p>Are you interested?  Are you an expert in any of these topics?  Would you like to be?</p>

<p>Most
 of all-- if you know an expert in this area or have a suggestion of 
someone we should contact, please pass along the news.  We need to build
 a strong base of expertise to get this off the ground and turn it into a
 resource for all of us.</p>

                <h1>(and here&#39;s the email we sent to our list about Aaron last month)</h1>
            

            

            

            <p>Tomorrow
 is the first anniversary of the win against SOPA, and instead this week
 has been crushingly sad.  Aaron Swartz was a friend, and we went to his
 funeral Tuesday.</p>
<p>Aaron
 was behind so much of the amazing activism you see on the web.  He 
helped Lessig start Creative Commons and helped get Reddit off the 
ground.  With David Segal he founded Demand Progress.  He gave us tons 
of advice and encouragement on Fight for the Future and even swooped in 
to fix our website at a crucial moment in the first SOPA protest (it was
 amazing to watch him work).</p>
<p>The tool that delivers your letters to Congress when you take action on our sites?  He built that.  Probably in a day or two.</p>
<p>It's
 fun and comforting to be in awe of him.  But all that "boy genius" 
stuff is not the important part.  The thing that distinguished Aaron 
more than his intelligence was that he was political and effective.  He 
didn't use his ability to make apps-- he used it to right wrongs.  But 
he didn't let the deep corruption in his Chomsky books turn him into a 
helpless cataloguer of the world's sins and scams.  He worked backwards 
to some steps he thought might--just maybe--make things better.  Part of
 my horror at losing him is how clutch he was to have on our side.  He 
was so powerful, versatile, and independent.  If this was chess, they 
took our queen.</p>
<p>But
 that's the one way he can be replaced.  Not as a friend.  And probably 
not by any single person on this planet.  But by a network of people 
infected with his brazen courage.  </p>
<p>I
 remember Aaron saying that one of the best things Fight for the Future 
could do-- beyond stopping or even passing any piece of legislation-- 
would be to encourage activists and geeks to think bigger and bolder. 
 In a world where any one of us can build things or say things that 
mobilize millions, handfuls of people can do so much.  So it matters 
what you think.  It matters what your dreams are.   And it makes a 
difference when you step up.</p>
<p>Seriously,
 this is 2013.  Kickstarter exists.  Bitcoin exists!  Half the planet 
will soon have the Internet in their pockets, and most of them aren't 
very happy with their governments or employers.  That's a lot to work 
with.   So try something! :)  In this email, there's no simple link to 
an action you can take; it's on you to make a plan.  But once you do, 
post it to #ForAaron ... we'd like to read it.</p>
<p>Aaron
 had so many friends and allies, and all of them want to make some 
lasting change in his memory, both to advance the causes he worked for 
and fix the unjust system that lead to his death.  These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing the CFAA, the law used to prosecute Aaron that makes harmless "terms of service" violations felonies</li>
<li>Requiring open access to <em>all</em> research that receives public funding</li>
<li>Building ever greater archives of open data</li>
<li>Creating consequences for prosecutors who bring disproportionate cases against the innocent or harmless</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll
 be helping on all of these fronts, personally or as FFTF.  As 
Massachusetts natives, we'll work to end the political careers of the 
prosecutors here who targeted Aaron.  </p>
<p>Finally,
 if you do anything right now, learn about depression.  Tiffiniy and I 
agree 100% with Aaron's family and closest friends that the actions of 
federal prosecutors and MIT were what killed him.   But there's more to 
it than that, and we can't shake the feeling that our community's 
responses to depression are failing brilliant people like Aaron.  Anyone
 who dreams big is going to encounter extreme stress.  Anyone who works 
independently, driven by their own values and goals is especially 
vulnerable to spirals of guilt, frustration and depression when they hit
 a wall or push past their limits.  The private, quiet lives that fuel 
our focus when we're happy become hellish traps when depression starts. 
 All of us someday will lose a parent, a partner, a sibling, or someone 
close to us.   If it hasn't happened to you, it will-- and it can throw 
you, hard.  So get help, don't be afraid to rely on others (including 
doctors or therapists) and when it hits your friends, go above and 
beyond for them.  If you have a project you'd like to pursue to address 
mental health issues at scale, using the Internet, be in touch-- we'd 
love to help in some way.</p>
<p>With sadness, and love,</p>
<p>Holmes Wilson
